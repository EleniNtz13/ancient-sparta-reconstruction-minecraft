# Ancient Sparta Acropolis - Minecraft 3D Reconstruction 📜⚔️🗿

What was the city of **Ancient Sparta**? 

Let us explore Ancient Sparta from its earliest days to the present.

This project was created as part of an educational assignment within the **“Cultural Informatics”** curriculum of the Department of Digital Systems in Sparta, aiming to connect *history* with *creativity*. The project was carried out with the collaboration and support of two fellow students, which enhanced its teamwork spirit and creativity. To maintain visual consistency within the reconstruction, the Agora was positioned closer to the other three monuments (the Temple of Athena, the Stoa, and the Ancient Theatre) than in its actual historical location.

### 🏺 Historical Overview of Sparta ###
**Sparta** was one of the most powerful cities of *Ancient Greece*, located along the Eurotas River in Laconia, in the southern Peloponnese. Its rise began after the Dorian invasion around *1100 BC* and peaked following its victory in the Peloponnesian War. Sparta became globally known for its military strength, strict discipline, and austere lifestyle.

The city was composed of five settlements: Kynosoura, Pitane, Limnai, Mesoa, and later Amyklai. Citizens lived in simple homes scattered across the plain surrounding the acropolis, which served as a sacred and civic center for worship, festivals, and public gatherings.

### 👑 Sparta’s Leadership in the 5th Century BC ###
This project focuses on the *5th century BC*, a period during which **King** **Leonidas** ruled Sparta and **Queen** **Gorgo** stood by his side. Sparta was then at the height of its military and political power, playing a dominant role in the ancient Greek world.

Leonidas is remembered for his heroic stand at the Battle of Thermopylae in *480 BC*, where he famously responded to the Persian demand to surrender with the phrase **“Molon Labe!” (“Come and take them”)** — a timeless symbol of defiance and sacrifice. Before his departure for battle, Queen Gorgo addressed him with the phrase **“Either with your shield or on it.”** reminding him of his patriotic duty and the honor of dying for one’s homeland. This expression reflects the courage with which Spartan women — as wives and mothers — faced the possibility of losing their loved ones in war, demanding that they return either victorious or carried home with honor.

Gorgo, one of the few women in antiquity known for her political insight, stood out for her intelligence and boldness. When asked why Spartan women were the only ones who “ruled” their men, she replied: **“Because we are the only women who give birth to men.”** Her words encapsulate the deep-rooted values of Spartan society — valor, honor, and the central role of women in shaping a nation of warriors.

### ⌛ Sparta Through the Ages: From Antiquity to Today ##
Remarkably, Sparta remained without defensive walls for centuries, as its warriors were considered sufficient protection. Fortifications were only built in the *3rd century BC* under King Cleomenes III and completed during the reign of King Nabis.

During the **Byzantine period**, Sparta lost its strategic importance, and residents relocated to fortified areas such as **Mystras**. The new city was built using materials from ancient Sparta, and by the end of Emperor Justinian’s reign, the original city was largely abandoned.

In modern times, following the **Greek Revolution of Independence in 1821**, Sparta remained inhabited but diminished in influence. In *1834*, King Otto ordered the construction of a new city on the ruins of the ancient one, designed in neoclassical style with wide streets and public squares.

### 🗿 From History to Monuments ###
Sparta’s rich historical journey — from antiquity to the modern era — stands as a symbol of military strength, discipline, and cultural identity. From the myth of **Helen of Troy** and the **heroic stand of Leonidas at Thermopylae**, to the founding of the modern city by King Otto, Sparta has preserved its legacy through the centuries.

In this project, we focus on the most significant monuments of the Acropolis of Ancient Sparta, as they were shaped *during the 6th to 4th centuries BC*. Through their three-dimensional reconstruction in the world of Minecraft, we aim to capture their architecture, function, and symbolic importance within the society of the time.
